# ProjectTwo
With our app you can search by zip code and see a history of places and types of crime that have occured over the past five years. With this app you can determine if itâ€™s safe to go for a walk or let your kids go for a bike ride. Our goal is to help families and individuals know what to expect in their neck of Tucson or what would be good place to call home. As a group we split up the responsibilities into parts.  Michaell was tasked with the login page and responsiveness. James did the  next part with the front end and database. Jenna brought up the middleware and pulled the frontend and backend together. Andrew decided to take on the challenge of creating the backend and being our anchor man.
